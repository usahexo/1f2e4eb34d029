#  Diamondbacks Lead MLB in Wins Against the Point Spread

The Arizona Diamondbacks lead all of MLB in wins against the point spread. They are currently 10-5 against the spread, which is good for a .667 winning percentage. The Diamondbacks have been especially good at home, going 7-2 against the spread. Their only two losses at home came against the Dodgers and the Rockies.

The Diamondbacks have had success this season by playing a balanced offensive game. They are currently fifth in MLB in runs scored, averaging 4.8 runs per game. They have also been solid defensively, ranking eighth in MLB with a .985 fielding percentage.

Key players for the Diamondbacks include Paul Goldschmidt, A.J. Pollock, and Zack Greinke. Goldschmidt is one of the best hitters in baseball and is currently batting .306 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs. Pollock is also having a great season, batting .292 with 12 homers and 43 RBIs. Greinke has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this year, posting a 14-5 record with a 2.84 ERA.

#  Why Bettors are Loving the Arizona Diamondbacks

The Arizona Diamondbacks were not expected to be contenders in the National League this season, but they have been one of the most surprising teams in baseball. The Diamondbacks currently sit in first place in the NL West with a record of 43-33.

So what has been the key to their success?

One reason for the Diamondbacks’ good start is their pitching staff. Led by ace Zack Greinke, the Diamondbacks’ pitching staff has a combined ERA of 3.75, which is sixth best in the majors. Greinke has been especially impressive, as he has a 10-5 record with a 3.00 ERA.

Another reason for the Diamondbacks’ success has been their offense. They are currently ranked third in the National League in runs scored and seventh in batting average. Paul Goldschmidt has been a driving force for the offense, as he leads the NL in home runs (22) and RBIs (64).

So why are bettors loving the Arizona Diamondbacks?

There are a few reasons. First, they are currently one of the most undervalued teams in baseball. Their odds to win the World Series are currently at 25-1, which makes them a good value bet. Second, they have one of the best pitchers in baseball leading their rotation and an offense that can put up some big numbers. Finally, they play in a weak division and should make it to the playoffs with relative ease.
