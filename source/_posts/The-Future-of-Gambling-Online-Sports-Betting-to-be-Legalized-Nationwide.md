#  The Future of Gambling: Online Sports Betting to be Legalized Nationwide

In May of this year, the United States Supreme Court overturned a 25-year ban on sports betting, declaring it a violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. This ruling paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

According to a report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, 11 states are currently considering measures that would legalize sports betting,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and many more are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.

The impact of this decision is far-reaching, with implications for both the gambling industry and the economy as a whole. Let’s take a closer look at some of the key points.

1. The legalization of online sports betting will create jobs and generate tax revenue.

Job growth is one of the main benefits of legalizing any new industry, and online sports betting is no exception. A study by Oxford Economics found that legalizing sports betting could lead to the creation of over 160,000 new jobs across the United States.

Additionally, legalized sports betting will generate significant tax revenue for states. According to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, revenue generated from legal sports betting could top $6 billion annually by 2023. This money can be used to fund important public services such as education and infrastructure improvements.

2. It will help protect consumers and combat illegal gambling.

One of the main reasons behind the repeal of PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) was to provide better consumer protections. With state-regulated sports betting, consumers will have access to safe and legal options, while bad actors in the industry will be prosecuted.

This increased regulation will also help combat illegal gambling, which is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry worldwide. By legitimizing sports gambling and bringing it under state control, lawmakers can better protect consumers from fraud and exploitation.

3. It will benefit businesses in states that legalize it.

In states that legalize sports betting, businesses stand to gain a great deal from increased tourism and spending by gamblers. Casinos and other gambling establishments will see an increase in customer traffic, while businesses that provide related services (hotels, restaurants, transportation) will also benefit financially.

4. It could lead to other forms of legalized gambling being introduced nationwide.

Once one type of gambling is legalized, it often sets a precedent for others to be legalized as well. This has been seen in other countries where online casino gaming and other forms of wagering have been introduced after sports betting was legalized. So it’s possible that we may see other forms of gambling being legalized in the United States in the years ahead.

#  Las Vegas Odds Shifted in Favor of Legalization of Online Sports Betting

The recent overturn of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) has led to a flurry of activity in the world of sports betting, with states rushing to approve legislation that would legalize the activity.

At present, Nevada is the only state where online sports betting is legal. However, with other states preparing to legalize the activity, Nevada stands to lose a significant amount of revenue.

To date, there has been no official estimate of how much revenue Nevada generates from online sports betting. However, it is estimated that legalizing online sports betting in all 50 states could generate as much as $5 billion in annual revenue.

This number could be even higher if more states legalize sports betting in addition to Nevada. New Jersey, which is leading the charge to legalize online sports betting, stands to gain the most from this development.

The legalization of online sports betting is also good news for bookmakers. In addition to being able to offer their services in additional states, they will also be able to do so legally. This will likely lead to an increase in business for them and could even help to stabilize the industry in light of rising competition from illegal bookmakers.

#  Justice Department Ends flip-flop, says Yes to sports betting

The Department of Justice has finally ended the flip-flop on its position on sports betting by stating that it believes that states have the authority to permit and regulate sports betting.

This reversal of opinion comes just days after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that outlawed most sports betting. The department’s new stance opens up the possibility for legalized sports betting in all 50 states, something that is eagerly anticipated by many who believe that it would bring much-needed revenue to state governments.

Critics of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased corruption in professional and amateur sports, as well as addiction problems for those who gamble excessively. However, proponents of legalization point to the fact that regulated sports betting already exists in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where it has been shown to be relatively safe and profitable.

It will now be up to each individual state to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting within its borders. Several states, including New Jersey and West Virginia, have already signaled their intention to do so.

#  Illinois could be Next State to Legalize Sports Betting

#

# The Illinois General Assembly is considering a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

#

# The bill, introduced by Rep. Mike Zalewski (D-Riverside), would allow people age 21 and older to bet on professional and college sports games.

#

# “This is an attempt to modernize our gambling laws, and to provide a new revenue stream for the state,” Zalewski said in a statement.

#

# Illinois is one of several states that are considering legalizing sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn a federal ban on the practice.

#

# If the bill is passed, Illinois would join Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia as states that have legalized sports betting.

#  Connecticut Moves Closer to Becoming a Hub for Legalized Sports Betting




Connecticut lawmakers are pushing to legalize sports betting as the state looks to position itself as a hub for the activity.

The effort is being spearheaded by the state’s top Democratic lawmaker, Senate President Martin Looney, who says legalized sports betting could bring in $100 million in annual revenue for the state.

 Connecticut currently has a law on the books that allows for limited sports betting, but only at tribal casinos. Looney and other lawmakers are looking to amend that law to allow for betting at commercial casinos and online.

The push comes as several other states have legalized sports betting in recent months, including New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia. The activity is also legal in Nevada and some other states.

Betting on professional and collegiate sporting events has been around for decades, but it has been illegal in most of the United States. That began to change last year when the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize the activity, citing potential tax revenue and job creation benefits. Proponents also argue that it will help keep gambling dollars within state borders.

Opponents of legalized sports betting say it can lead to addiction and other social ills. They also note that it could create conflicts of interest for athletes and others involved in sporting events.
