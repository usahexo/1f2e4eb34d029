#  Oklahoma City Thunder Shock the World, Win NBA Championship in Historic Comeback

The Oklahoma City Thunder have won the NBA championship in a historic comeback.

Trailing 3-1 in the series, the Thunder shocked the world by winning the next three games, including two on the road, to take home the championship.

It was an amazing series, with each team taking turns beating the other at their best game.

In the end, it was the Thunder who were able to pull out the victory when it mattered most.

Russell Westbrook was named Finals MVP after averaging a triple double for the series.

This is a great redemption for Westbrook, who was criticized heavily for his poor performance in last year's playoffs.

Now he can proudly say that he is a champion.

#  In Sports Gambling, How Does a Parley Job? 

A parley is a type of sports gambling in which a bettor wagers on two or more outcomes of the same event with the intent to increase the potential payout. In order for the bet to be placed, all outcomes must be correct. For example, if a person bets on Team A to win and Team B to lose in a parlay, both bets must win in order for the person to collect on the parlay. Parlays are also available as reverse bets, in which the bettor predicts that two teams will lose. 

There are three different types of payouts that can be earned from a successful parlay: 
-The standard payout for a parlay is 6/1 odds. This means that if someone wagers $10 on a two-team parlay and both teams win, they would earn a total payout of $60 (6 times their original wager plus their initial wager). 
-A “pick ‘em” pays out even money, or 1/1 odds. So if someone wagered $10 on a two-team pick ‘em parlay and both teams won, they would earn a total payout of $20 (double their original investment). 
-A “teaser” involves adjusting the point spread or totals in favor of the player, which results in increased winnings but also increased risks. The payouts for teasers vary depending on how many teams are involved and what type of teaser it is.

#  Thunder's Westbrook Could Soon Be Highest-Paid Player in NBA History

Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook is in the middle of his seventh season in the NBA. Heading into the final year of his contract, Westbrook has a chance to become the league's highest-paid player.

Westbrook is currently making $28.5 million this season. If he opts out of his contract and re-signs with the Thunder, he could receive a five-year deal worth over $200 million. That would make him the highest-paid player in NBA history.

Other top players in the league, such as Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant and Houston Rockets guard James Harden, are also eligible for maximum contracts this offseason. However, they may not be able to match Westbrook's potential new deal.

Durant is expected to sign a four-year deal worth over $160 million this offseason. And Harden may sign a four-year deal worth over $170 million.

Westbrook has been one of the most productive players in the NBA over the past few years. He averaged a triple-double last season and was named MVP of the 2017-2018 season. This year, he's averaging 21.2 points, 10.3 assists, and 10.1 rebounds per game.

#  Oklahoma City Thunder Are the New Golden State Warriors of the West

The Oklahoma City Thunder were one of the most exciting teams in the NBA last season. Led by MVP Russell Westbrook, they made it to the playoffs but were ultimately defeated by the Houston Rockets. This season, they appear to be even better and are currently the second seed in the Western Conference.

Many people are calling the Thunder the new Golden State Warriors of the West. They have a lot of similarities, starting with their star players. Westbrook and Steph Curry are both incredibly talented and can take over a game at any moment.

The Thunder also have a very deep roster. They have multiple players who can score in bunches and can come up big in big games. The Warriors have a similar team composition, with players like Klay Thompson and Draymond Green who can also take over a game when needed.

The Thunder definitely have what it takes to make it to the Finals this year. They’ve already beaten some of the top teams in the league, including the Golden State Warriors and Rockets. If they continue to play at this level, there’s no doubt that they will be crowned champions this season.

#  With Warriors Falling Apart, Oklahoma City Thunder Poised to Emerge as NBA's Best Team

The Golden State Warriors are no longer the unquestioned best team in the NBA.

Their 108-85 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Feb. 6 was their third consecutive loss and fourth in their past six games.

The Thunder, meanwhile, have been on a roll, winning their past six games.

Oklahoma City is now the No. 1 team in the NBA with a 43-14 record, while Golden State is No. 2 with a 42-14 record.

What has caused the Warriors' recent struggles?

There are several factors at play.

First and foremost, Stephen Curry has not been playing well lately. He is averaging just 24.3 points on 41.5 percent shooting from the field and 30.8 percent shooting from 3-point range over his past 10 games.
2) The Warriors are also dealing with injuries. Backup center JaVale McGee has missed the past four games with a left ankle sprain, and backup forward Andre Iguodala has missed the past five games with a left knee sprain. Both players are important contributors off the bench for Golden State. 
3) The Thunder have been playing better team basketball lately. They are sharing the ball more and relying less on individual scoring efforts from stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Westbrook is averaging 9.5 assists over his past 10 games, while George is averaging 5 assists over his past 10 games.
