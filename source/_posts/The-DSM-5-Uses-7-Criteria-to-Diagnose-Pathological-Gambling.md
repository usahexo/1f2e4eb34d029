A person with a gambling problem is someone whose gambling has negative consequences on their life, such as job loss, family problems, financial difficulties, or psychological distress. Pathological gambling is a diagnosable mental disorder in the DSM-5 if it meets 5 criteria.

Gambling becomes their top priority and they will continue to gamble even when it’s causing them harm.

The third criterion is that the person experiences withdrawal symptoms when they stop gambling. This can include feeling irritable, anxious, or depressed. Additionally, they may have physical symptoms such as sweating, nausea, or headaches.

The fourth criterion is that the person keeps gambling even though it’s causing them harm. They may lose their job, home, or relationships because of their gambling addiction.

The fifth and final criterion is that the person’s gambling behaviour is defined as obsessive-compulsive . They may keep thinking about betting and trying to fix past losses even though this is causing them problems in their life.
