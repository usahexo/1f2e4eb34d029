#  Minimum Gambling Age for Indian Casinos Drops to 18

The minimum gambling age for Indian casinos has been lowered from 21 to 18, effective immediately. Governor Jerry Brown signed the measure into law on Thursday, stating that it would "help stimulate economic development and create jobs in tribal communities."

Opponents of the measure fear that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates, especially among young people. Proponents argue that the risk is worth it, as the additional revenue will help tribes pay for essential services such as education and healthcare.

This is not the first time that California has lowered the gambling age. In 1999, the state passed a law allowing 18-year-olds to gamble in tribal casinos. However, that law was later overturned by a federal court.

It is not yet clear how many of California's 58 tribes will choose to lower their minimum gambling age. However, given the potential benefits, it is likely that at least some tribes will take advantage of this new law.

#  Lowering Minimum Age for Gambling in Indian Casinos Could Hurt Kids

There is a possibility that the minimum age for gambling in Indian casinos could be lowered from 21 to 18. This change would have a negative impact on children, many of whom are already struggling with addiction.

Gambling is addictive, and it can be very difficult for young people to resist the temptation to gamble if the minimum age is lowered. The younger someone starts gambling, the more likely it is that they will develop an addiction to it.

The consequences of addiction can be devastating for young people. Addiction can lead to problems in school and at work, as well as financial problems and legal issues. Addiction can also have a negative impact on relationships with friends and family members.

It is important to remember that gambling is not just a harmless fun pastime. Gambling can cause serious harm to young people, and it is important to protect them from this harm by keeping the minimum age at 21.

#  Why Indian Casinos Are Choosing to Lower the Minimum Age for Gambling

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 governs gambling in Native American casinos in the United States. This act allows tribes to operate casinos on their reservations if the state where the reservation is located has legalized gambling. The IGRA sets the minimum age for gambling at 18, but many Indian casinos are choosing to lower this age to better serve their customers and increase profits.

Lowering the minimum age for gambling can be a lucrative decision for Indian casinos. There are a number of reasons for this. First, young people have more free time and money to spend than older adults. Second, many young people develop addictions to gambling at an early age, which can lead to loyalty and repeat business from these customers.

Third, young people are more likely to gamble impulsively than older adults. This can lead to more losses per customer but also more excitement and entertainment value for the casino. Fourth, lowering the minimum age opens up new markets for casino operators who may not have been able to attract older customers before.

Finally, lowering the minimum age allows casino operators to capture a larger share of the overall gambling market. This is important because the gambling market is growing rapidly; in 2017, it was worth an estimated $241 billion worldwide.

There are some risks associated with lowering the minimum age for gambling, but these appear to be outweighed by the potential benefits. One potential risk is that younger gamblers may be more likely to develop problems with addiction or financial instability than older gamblers. However, there is no evidence that this is actually the case; in fact, some studies suggest that younger gamblers are less likely to experience negative consequences from gambling than older adults are.

Another potential risk is that younger gamblers may be more likely to make bad decisions that lead to large losses. However, again there is no evidence that this is actually the case; in fact, many young people exhibit good judgement when it comes to gambling and manage their money responsibly.

Overall, there is strong evidence that lowering the minimum age for gambling can be a positive move for Indian casinos. By catering to young customers, casinos can increase their profits while also providing more excitement and entertainment value for their guests.

#  What Impact Will Lowering the Minimum Age Have on Indian Casinos?

With the recent news that New York may be lowering the minimum age for casino gambling from 21 to 18, many people are wondering what impact this could have on Indian casinos. The stricter regulations on Indian casinos have long been a thorn in the side of tribal leaders, and it seems that the federal government may be starting to loosen its grip.

As it stands now, there are fewer than half a dozen states where the minimum age for casino gambling is 18. For most states, including New York, the minimum age is 21. This gap in regulations has led to a significant disparity in revenues between Indian casinos and casinos in other states.

In 2011, the state of New York earned over $9 billion from casino gambling. Of that amount, only $10 million came from Indian casinos. In contrast, neighboring Pennsylvania earned over $1.3 billion from their 14 Indian casinos.

Lowering the minimum age to 18 is not likely to bridge this revenue gap completely, but it could help to level the playing field somewhat. Indian casino operators are hopeful that this change will lead to increased investment in their properties and more jobs for tribal members.

#  Is 18 the New Minimum Age for Gambling at Indian Casinos?

The Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes, which operate the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos, have asked the US Department of the Interior to lower the minimum age for gambling from 21 to 18.

The tribes say that doing so would make them more competitive with casinos in other states, which have a minimum age of 18. They also argue that it would be good for the economy, as younger gamblers tend to spend more money on casino games than older ones.

The request is currently under review by the Department of the Interior. If it is approved, it will be up to the individual states to decide whether or not to lower their own minimum age for gambling.

So far, there has been no indication as to what the Department of the Interior's decision will be.
