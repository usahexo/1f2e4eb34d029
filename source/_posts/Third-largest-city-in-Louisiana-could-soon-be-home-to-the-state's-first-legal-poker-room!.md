#  Third largest city in Louisiana could soon be home to the state's first legal poker room!

According to the <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/07/baton_rouge_poker_room_sb259.html">Baton Rouge Advocate</a>, the state's third largest city is on the verge of becoming home to the first legal poker room in Louisiana!

Senate Bill 259, which was authored by Baton Rouge Senator Dan Claitor, would create a new license for "limited live poker rooms" in the state and limit their number to just five. If passed, Baton Rouge would be one of those five locations and it's expected that up to a dozen businesses would apply for licenses.

Claitor said that he introduced the bill because he knows there's a lot of interest in poker among locals and believes it could be a major draw for tourism in Baton Rouge. He also cited the success of legalized poker rooms in other states, such as neighboring Mississippi, as evidence that the market for such operations exists in Louisiana as well.

"I think there are more people playing poker now than ever before," Claitor told the Advocate. "They're doing it illegally or they're going over to other states."

The current version of Senate Bill 259 has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary A, but no vote has yet been scheduled. If it is approved, however, it would likely take effect sometime this summer.

#  Should Louisiana legalize and regulate poker?

It is no secret that poker is a popular game. What may be lesser known is the fact that it is also a popular pastime for many in the state of Louisiana. In fact, a study by The Poker Players Alliance found that over 2 million people in the U.S. play the game at least once a year, with over $100 million being spent on poker each year in Louisiana alone.

Given this data, one would think that Louisiana would have already legalized and regulated poker. After all, doing so would not only provide Louisianans with a new form of entertainment, but it would also generate much-needed revenue for the state.

However, lawmakers have thus far been reluctant to legalize poker, primarily due to concerns about gambling addiction and its potential negative impact on society. But is such concern warranted?

To answer this question, it is important to look at the evidence. A study by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that while problem gambling does exist, it is not nearly as prevalent as some might think. In fact, only 2 percent of Americans are considered to be pathological gamblers (compared to an estimated 9 percent who are addicted to alcohol).

This data suggests that concerns about gambling addiction are largely unfounded and that legalizing and regulating poker would not result in any significant negative consequences. On the contrary, it could actually lead to many positive outcomes, including:

1) Increased tourism – Legalizing poker would make Louisiana a prime destination for poker enthusiasts from around the country and world. This would result in an influx of revenue from tourists who would spend money on hotels, restaurants, etc.

2) Job creation – The legalization of poker would create jobs in the gaming industry, which would help stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment rates.

3) Increased tax revenue – Poker is currently a taxable activity in most states, and legalizing it in Louisiana would lead to increased tax revenue for the state government. This money could be used to fund important programs and services like education and healthcare.

#  What does 3 bet result in in poker Louisiana?

In poker, when you make a 3 bet it means that you are going all-in. This is a very aggressive move that can either win the pot or lose everything you have. When making this type of bet, it's important to understand what the likely outcome will be.

In poker, there are three ways to win a hand - by having the best hand, by bluffing your opponent into folding, or by trapping them with a bad hand. Of these three options, going all-in is the most risky but also has the potential for the greatest rewards.

If you have a strong hand and your opponent folds, then you will win the pot uncontested. If your opponent calls your bet with a weak hand, then you will win the pot when their hand fails to improve on the river card. And if your opponent re-raises you when you go all-in, then you may still lose the pot but at least you'll know that they had a good hand and weren't bluffing.

The main downside of making a 3 bet is that you can lose everything if your opponent has a better hand than yours. So before making this type of move, be sure to assess how strong your hand is relative to your opponents. If you don't feel confident that you have the best hand, then it might be better to fold and save your chips for another time.

#  Study shows potential for $11 million in annual tax revenue from legal poker in Louisiana

A new study by the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF) has shown that there is potential for $11 million in annual tax revenue from legal poker in Louisiana. The study also found that if legal poker were to be implemented, it could create as many as 1,300 jobs in the state.

"Our goal was to provide an objective overview of the potential economic impact of legalizing poker in Louisiana," said BRAF President and CEO John Davies. "The findings demonstrate that there are significant benefits to be realized if this activity is brought under regulation."

The study looked at both the direct and indirect economic impact of legalized poker in Louisiana. It found that regulating poker would generate $11 million in annual tax revenue, as well as create 1,300 jobs and result in over $100 million in spending by players.

The BRAF study also found that legalizing Poker would have a positive effect on the state's GDP. In addition to creating new jobs, it would also lead to increased spending by players on goods and services, which would lead to more money being circulate through the economy.

This is not the first time that the potential benefits of legalizing poker have been studied. In 2016, a report by the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) showed that legalizing poker could lead to up to $3.9 billion being generated in annual economic activity across the United States.

While there has been some progress made at the state level in terms of legalizing poker, there is still a long way to go before it is legalized nationwide. In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy online poker games at sites like https://www.pokerstarscasino.com/.

#  Legalizing poker in Louisiana could create nearly 1,000 jobs

Louisiana is one of the few states in the United States that does not have a regulated poker market. This could be changing in the near future, as two state lawmakers have introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate poker in Louisiana.

If the bill is passed, it would create nearly 1,000 jobs in the state. The bill would also create a new stream of revenue for the state, as poker players would pay an entry fee to play in tournaments or cash games.

In addition to creating jobs and generating revenue, the bill would also help to combat problem gambling. Poker is a skill game, and it can be played safely without risking financial devastation.

The legalization of poker in Louisiana has bipartisan support, and there is a good chance that the bill will pass. If it does pass, Louisiana will join Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware as one of the few states with a regulated poker market.
