Gold bars are one of the most popular symbols in Las Vegas slots. They are also one of the most lucrative, as they can award some truly massive payouts. If you're looking to add a touch of luxury to your gameplay and potentially win big in the process, using gold bars in your bets is the way to go.

In this article, we'll teach you everything you need to know about using gold bars in Big Fish Casino: Las Vegas Slots. We'll start by outlining the different ways that gold bars can be used in the game, then we'll talk about some of the best strategies for putting them to use. Finally, we'll give you a few tips on how to make the most out of your gold bar bets.

So without further ado, let's get started!

How Gold Bars Work In Big Fish Casino: Las Vegas Slots

There are three primary ways that gold bars can be used in Big Fish Casino: Las Vegas Slots: as a bonus multiplier, as a wild symbol, and as part of a jackpot combination. Let's take a look at each of them in more detail.

Bonus Multiplier

The first way that gold bars can be used is as a bonus multiplier. When you land two or more gold bars anywhere on the reels, your bet will be multiplied by 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x depending on how many gold bars you hit. This can result in some pretty massive payouts if you're lucky enough to hit a few multipliers in a row.

Wild Symbol

The second way that gold bars can be used is as a wild symbol. When you land one or more gold bars on an active payline, they will act as wilds and help to complete winning combinations. This can lead to some substantial payouts when combined with other high-value symbols.

Jackpot Combination

The third way that gold bars can be used is as part of a jackpot combination. If you hit three or more gold bars anywhere on the reels, you'll qualify for one of the game's four progressive jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major, or Grandiose Jackpot. The size of these jackpots varies depending on how much has been wagered on the game overall, but they can typically reach into the thousands (or even tens of thousands) of dollars. So if you're looking for some serious potential payouts, look out for those all-important gold bars!


Now that we've covered how gold bars work in Big Fish Casino: Las Vegas Slots, let's move on to some tips and tactics for using them effectively during gameplay. Here are a few pointers to get you started:
