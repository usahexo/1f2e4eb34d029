#  What is Instant Velodrome? 

Instant Velodrome is an online multiplayer cycling game where players can race against each other in real time. The game offers realistic graphics and a wide range of customization options for bikes and riders. In addition to the standard race mode, there are also time trial and sprint modes to test your skills.

The controls are easy to learn but difficult to master.
