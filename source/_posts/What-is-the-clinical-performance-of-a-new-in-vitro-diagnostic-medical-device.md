#  What is the clinical performance of a new in vitro diagnostic medical device?

The clinical performance of a new in vitro diagnostic medical device is how well it works when used by healthcare professionals to diagnose a patient’s illness. This can be determined through clinical trials, which are studies that compare the results of using the new device with those of using current methods.

If the new device performs as well as or better than the current methods, then it is likely to be adopted by healthcare professionals. However, if the new device does not perform as well, then it may not gain widespread acceptance.

It is important for companies that develop new in vitro diagnostic devices to conduct rigorous clinical trials in order to ensure that their products are safe and effective. By doing so, they can improve the chances of their devices being adopted by healthcare professionals and help improve patient outcomes.

#  How will market authorization be granted for a new in vitro diagnostic medical device?

A new in vitro diagnostic medical device faces a rigorous and expensive approval process before it can be marketed. The market authorization pathway for a new IVDMD is described below.

1. The first step in the process is to file an application with the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The application must include a proposed product labeling, a description of the device, information on the manufacturing process, and test data demonstrating that the device meets FDA safety and efficacy standards.

2. CDRH will review the application to make sure it is complete and that the proposed product labeling is acceptable. If additional information is needed, CDRH will contact the applicant.

3. Once CDRH has everything it needs, it will begin its review of the data. This review can take many months or even years to complete.

4. If CDRH finds that the device meets its safety and efficacy standards, it will issue a marketing authorization known as a premarket notification (PMN). A PMN authorizes commercial distribution of the device in the U.S.

5. The applicant must then comply with all postmarket requirements outlined in the PMN, including submission of annual reports and reporting any adverse events associated with use of the device.

#  What are the post-market surveillance requirements for a new in vitro diagnostic medical device?

The FDA has several post-market surveillance requirements for a new in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device. 

One of the most important post-market surveillance requirements is the establishment and maintenance of a system to receive reports of device failures. This system must be able to track each individual device throughout its distribution and use. In addition, manufacturers must establish and maintain procedures for investigating and resolving complaints associated with their devices.

The FDA also requires that IVD manufacturers participate in a program called MedWatch. This program is responsible for collecting information about adverse events related to medical devices, including IVDs. The data collected through this program helps the FDA identify potential risks associated with medical devices, including IVDs.

Manufacturers must also submit Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). PSURs are required every 6 months for the first 3 years after a device is placed on the market, then annually thereafter. PSURs provide updates on the safety and effectiveness of a device, as well as any new information that may impact the safety or effectiveness of the device.

#  When can manufacturers begin selling new in vitro diagnostic medical devices?

The sale of new in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) may commence as soon as the product is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating all medical devices, including IVDs. In order to market a new IVD, manufacturers must file a 510(k) application with the FDA.

A510(k) is a premarket notification submission that allows the FDA to determine whether a new device is substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed device. The 510(k) submission must include information on the device's intended use, design, manufacturing, labeling and performance. The FDA will also review safety and effectiveness data for the new device.

If a new IVD is found to be substantially equivalent to an already marketed device, then it can be sold in the United States. If a new IVD is not substantially equivalent to an already marketed device, then it may require additional clinical testing or regulatory review before it can be sold in the United States.

#  What are the consequences for not complying with New In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation?

Since the New In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) was implemented in May 2017, companies have been struggling to comply with its requirements. Failing to do so can have serious consequences, including being unable to market devices in the European Union (EU) and being fined.

The IVDR lays out specific regulations for medical devices that are intended to test substances in the human body, such as blood or tissue. These types of devices are known as in vitro diagnostics (IVDs).

Under the IVDR, all manufacturers and distributors of IVDs must apply for a unique device identifier (UDI) and register their devices with a European online portal. They must also provide detailed product information, including a description of the device, how it works, how it’s used, and what risks it poses.

Devices that don’t meet the requirements of the IVDR can be seized by EU authorities. Companies that continue to sell non-compliant devices can be fined up to 4% of their annual global turnover or €20 million (whichever is greater), whichever is greater.

Thus far, regulators have been lenient in enforcing these regulations. However, that may change in the coming months as authorities become better acquainted with the new rules. Companies that haven’t yet complied with the IVDR should do so as soon as possible to avoid any penalties.
