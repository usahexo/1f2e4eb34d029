## What is a Blackjack?

A blackjack is a leather-covered club that is used as a self-defense weapon. It is also known as a slapper or sap, and has a flat profile with a loop on one end for the user's wrist.

## How to Use a Blackjack

1. Grip the blackjack firmly by the loop end, with the leather-covered flat side facing outward.
2. Aim for the soft tissue areas of your attacker's body, such as the neck, stomach, or thighs.
3. Strike your attacker quickly and forcefully, using a swinging motion to generate maximum force.
4. If you need to strike multiple times, aim for different areas of the body to increase the chances of incapacitating your attacker.
5. After using the blackjack, move quickly and calmly away from the scene to ensure your own safety.
