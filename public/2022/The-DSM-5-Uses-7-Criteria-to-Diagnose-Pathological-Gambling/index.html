The DSM-5, which was published in May 2013, uses 10 criteria to diagnose pathological gambling.</p>
<p>The first criterion is that the person has gambled repeatedly in a way that has caused significant problems in their life. This could include problems with family, friends, work, or finance.</p>
<p>The second criterion is that the person has been unable to control their gambling behavior. They may have tried to stop gambling but have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The third criterion is that the person has been obsessed with gambling and has thought about it all the time.</p>
<p>The fourth criterion is that the person has risked significant amounts of money on gambling even though they cannot afford to lose it.</p>
<p>The fifth criterion is that the person has had to lie about their gambling or conceal their behavior from others.</p>
<p>The sixth criterion is that the person has suffered from negative consequences as a result of their gambling, such as financial problems, job loss, or criminal activity.</p>
<p>The seventh criterion is that the person’s moods have changed as a result of their gambling. For example, they may feel depressed, anxious, or guilty after gambling.</p>
<p>The eighth criterion is that the person has experienced withdrawal symptoms when they have stopped gambling abruptly. This could include mood swings, irritability, and cravings for gambling activities.</p>
<p>The ninth criterion is that the person’s physical health has deteriorated as a result of their gambling habit. This could include things like stress, insomnia, and eating disorders.</p>

Pathological gambling is a diagnosable mental disorder in the DSM-5 if it meets 5 criteria.</p>
<p>The first criterion for pathological gambling is that the person has to gamble more than they intend to or can afford. They may start gambling with money they don’t have or sell possessions in order to get more money to gamble with. Gambling becomes their top priority and they will continue to gamble even when it’s causing them harm.</p>
<p>The second criterion is that the person has a tolerance for gambling. They need to gamble more and more over time to get the same level of excitement or pleasure. This can lead to ruinous financial consequences.</p>
<p>The third criterion is that the person experiences withdrawal symptoms when they stop gambling. This can include feeling irritable, anxious, or depressed. Additionally, they may have physical symptoms such as sweating, nausea, or headaches.</p>
<p>The fourth criterion is that the person keeps gambling even though it’s causing them harm. They may lose their job, home, or relationships because of their gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The fifth and final criterion is that the person’s gambling behaviour is defined as obsessive-compulsive . They may keep thinking about betting and trying to fix past losses even though this is causing them problems in their life.</p>
